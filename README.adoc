= Ensemble Programming Server

This project aims at solving the problem of attendance saying
"please run the tests" again and again during ensemble programming sessions.

To do so, the design will be the following:

1. at session start, somebody connects to the webapp and create a session.
 It will then display a QR-Code for the attendee to scan

2. each attendee scan the QR-Code, provides his/her name and is given access
 to a button that will allow to run tests at anytime

3. At the same time, the owner of the code connects his/her Intellij to
 the server
